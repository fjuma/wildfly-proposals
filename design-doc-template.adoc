Generally a feature should have documentation as part of the PR to wildfly master, or as a follow up PR if the feature is in wildfly-core. In some cases though the documentation belongs more in a component, or does not need any documentation. Indicate which of these will happen.

Draft verbiage for up to a few sentences on the feature for inclusion in the
Release Note blog article for the release that first includes this feature.

what release it appears in.  "See Overview" is acceptable if the overview is
suitable. For simple features best covered as an item in a bullet-point list 
of features containing a few words on each, use "Bullet point: <The few words>"
