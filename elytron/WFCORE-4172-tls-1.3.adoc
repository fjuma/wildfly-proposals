== Overview

JDK 11 has added support for TLS 1.3. This task is to update Elytron to be able to make use of TLS 1.3.

=== Hard Requirements

* It should be possible to configure a ```server-ssl-context``` and ```client-ssl-context``` in the Elytron subsystem
using the TLS 1.3 protocol and TLS 1.3 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#appendix-B.4[cipher suites]. (Note
that TLS 1.2 cipher suites cannot be used with TLS 1.3 and vice and versa.)

** A new attribute ```cipher-suite-names``` will be added to both ```server-ssl-context``` and ```client-ssl-context```
   to specify the TLS 1.3 cipher suites that should be enabled. The format will be a colon (:) separated list of
   cipher suite names (similar to the new OpenSSL-style TLS 1.3 ```ciphersuites``` option).

** The default value for the ```cipher-suite-names``` attribute will be the same as the OpenSSL default cipher suites for
   TLS 1.3:
   ```"TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"```

** Example configuration:

[source,xml]
----
   <server-ssl-context name="myTLS13ServerContext" ... cipher-suite-names="TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"/>
----
[source,xml]
----
   <client-ssl-context name="myTLS13ClientContext" ... cipher-suite-names="TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"/>
----

* It should be possible to configure subsystems that reference an ```ssl-context``` to make use of this TLS 1.3 ```server-ssl-context```.

* It should be possible to configure an ```ssl-context``` using the Elytron authentication client using the TLS 1.3
protocol and TLS 1.3 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#appendix-B.4[cipher suites].

** A new attribute ```names``` will be added to the ```cipher-suite``` element to specify the TLS 1.3 cipher suites that
   should be enabled. The format will be a colon (:) separated list of cipher suite names (similar to the new OpenSSL-style
   TLS 1.3 ```ciphersuites``` option).
** The default value for the ```cipher-suite-names``` option will be the same as the OpenSSL default cipher suites for
   TLS 1.3:
   ```"TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"```

** Example configuration:
[source,xml]
----
   <ssl-context name="myTLS13Context">
   ...
     <cipher-suite names="TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"/>
   ...
   </ssl-context>

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

One-way and two-way SSL tests will be added that make use of the TLS 1.3 protocol and TLS 1.3 cipher suites.
The ```java.specification.version``` system property will be used to make sure that these new tests only get run
when JDK 11 is in use.

One thing that is important to note is that TLS 1.3 has made session IDs essentially
http://openjdk.5641.n7.nabble.com/SSLSocket-session-resumption-not-working-with-TLS-1-3-and-11-27-td347431.html#a347563[obsolete].
This means that the session ID can no longer reliably be used to test if a session was resumed. Instead, creation time
can be used to test if a session was resumed. Currently, clients need to read from server after the first handshake in
order to receive the ```NewSessionTicket``` that can be used for resumption. However, this may change once
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8209953[JDK-8209953] is resolved.

== Community Documentation

Documentation will be added in the "Using the Elytron Subsystem" section in the WildFly documentation to indicate
that the TLS 1.3 protocol can be used with JDK 11. The documentation should mention the limitations around session resumption.
