== Overview

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFCORE-4172[WFCORE-4172] added support for TLS 1.3 when using the
JSSE TLS provider with Elytron. This task is to add support for TLS 1.3 when using the OpenSSL TLS
provider with Elytron.

=== Hard Requirements

* When using the OpenSSL TLS provider with Elytron, it should be possible to make use of TLS 1.3
  by configuring the `cipher-suite-names` attribute in a `server-ssl-context` or in a
  `client-ssl-context` in the Elytron subsystem.
  ** Whether or not TLS 1.3 should be used by default when the OpenSSL TLS provider is in
     use and the `cipher-suite-names` attribute has not been specified will need to be
     determined using the performance tests that were used for
     https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFCORE-4172[WFCORE-4172].


** Example configuration:

[source,xml]
----
   /subsystem=elytron/server-ssl-context=myTLS13Context:add(cipher-suite-names=TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, ...)
----
[source,xml]
----
   /subsystem=elytron/client-ssl-context=myTLS13ClientContext:add(cipher-suite-names=TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, ...)

* When using the OpenSSL TLS provider with Elytron, it should be possible to make use of TLS 1.3
  by configuring the `cipher-suite names` attriute in an `ssl-context` using the Elytron
  authentication client.

   ...
   </ssl-context>

=== Nice-to-Have Requirements

=== Non-Requirements

== Test Plan

All testing should be done using the OpenSSL TLS provider. The TLS 1.3 cipher suites that are
actually available will depend on this provider.

One-way and two-way SSL tests will be added to the WildFly OpenSSL testsuite and to the WildFly
Core testsuite that make use of the TLS 1.3 protocol and TLS 1.3 cipher suites. The `java.specification.version`
system property will be used to make sure that these new tests only get run when JDK 11 or higher
is in use since TLS 1.3 was only introduced in JDK 11.

== Community Documentation

Documentation on how to use the OpenSSL TLS provider with Elytron is being added to the "OpenSSL"
section in the Elytron documentation (see https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-13084[WFLY-13084]).

The "OpenSSL" section will then be updated to indicate that the TLS 1.3 protocol can be used with
the OpenSSL TLS provider by configuring the `cipher-suite-names` attribute.

== Release Note Content

It is now possible to use TLS 1.3 with WildFly when using the OpenSSL TLS provider with Elytron.
